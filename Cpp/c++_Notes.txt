C 
-----------------

  Software:set of programs.
  Program:set of instructions/commands
  Hardware:set of components
  Programming language:c,c++,java.....
  Softwares are classified into 2 types(system,application software)
  System:o/s
  app s/w:notepad,msword,calc.....
  Embeded Systems:combination of s/w and hardware.

  c and c++ are the best llang in the world which can interact with hardware effeciently.


  Advantage:beter interaction with hardware,i can design system or app softwares,i can design code fr device drivers,even u can design a virus program,graphic designing,protocol developement,.....etc.


Disadvantages:it is not platform independent,not secure,not language independent,poor error handling...etc.

Editors fr C/C++:eclipse,turbo/borland c,turbo c++,gc,gc++,visual c/C++....etc
----------------------------------------

Data:0,1,alphabets,audio,video...which is not organized
information:organized


 compiler:software program.
 Loader:software program whose responsibility is to place ur code for execution.
 Binary language:0/1
 Syntax:rules which u need to follow.
 

datatype:23,'p',9.00

container:to store
  
 variables to store data.
  
=,+,-,*===>arthimetic
  
 >,<,>=,<=used fr conditional testing
  

  a=9;===>assign value to variable
 
  == is used fr comparision.

  in mode===>scanf function
  out mode==>printf
  error 

 main()==>main() is userdefined.

 write a program to swap two numbers without using third variable and within one expression.
c++
--------

C is structured
c++ is object based programming language which also folows procedure oriented.

when we can called a pl as object oriented?

object
class
polymorphism:one thing multiple forms.
--overloading
   one function multiple forms
   one constructor multiple forms
--overriding
inheritance
message passing
abstraction
encapsulation


functions,pointers,files are same in c++.

object:identity,switchon(),switchoff(),on/off

every object will have SBI(state,behaviour,identity).
were ever u r having object,fr sure u will have class.
class---object

1)if class exists means no rule that object shld exist.
2)if object is there means fr sure class shld exist.
3)class without memory is useless.
4)memory for class is allocated after creating an object.
syntax for creating object:
5)cout is similar to printf in C
6)cin is similar to scanf in c.
cout==OUT Mode
CIn==IN mode
error=ERROR Mode

cin/cout comes under io pack.

classnmae objectname;

:: to access global varaiables in C++.

if u want to represent using C++,then it is as follows.


global,locl variables.

access specifiers:public,private,protected,default.

   abcd()
{
}

a function with body is called as concrete method.can we create obj?
without body is called as abstract.

if u want to wrk on abstract classes,u need to know virtual functions.

int abcd;
abcd();

----------------------------------------
A abstrct class can have mix(con,abs)
concrete only concrete mth.
abstrct shld be atleast one virtual function.

Syntax:
virtual returntype functionmae()=0;

-------------------------------------------
Templates:

In java same templates are called as Generics.

if you are not aware of the type of data which u r receiving from source(scanf,file).
T a;
a=90;
a='p';

Disadvantage:No control on the code.
Syntax of Function template:

template <class type>
ret-type func-name(parameter list) {
   // body of function
} 

Constructor:a constructor is a member function whose name is same as class name
but with no return type.


int abcd(int a,char b){}
void abcd(char a,char b){}
function overloading

overloading can be done for functions and constructors.
1)if u want to overload any thing,atleast return type shld change or no of parameters shld be diff,or datatype for parameters shld be differ.



class A
{
A(int a)
{
}
A(float b)
{
}
void ff()
{
}
};

 A obj(2),obj1(7.8);
obj.ff();

------------------------------------------------
Exception Handling:

What will hapen if i get an error?
  
It will simply stop executionof ur program.then we need to handle the exception.

try
{
int a;
}
catch(exceptionsss e)
{
cout<<e;
}
when ever we are having sensitive code,which can provne to errors,then surrunder ur code with try block.and handle the suitation using
catch blok.

1 try=u can have multiple catches
Nested try are also possible.
if exception araises in try block,then control moves to catch otherwise control never moves to catch.

Command Line arguments:
----------------------
if u want to pass any arguments to main methods,u can do it thru cmd line arguments.

argc==argument count
argv==variable arguments.

Inheritance:
-------------

Rules
----
1)atleast 2 classes shld be there to perform inheritance.
2)Private methods cannot be inherited.
3)Child inherits properties from Base class.
4)Base class will never inherit properties from child class.

Base class/Parent class
Child class
to perform inheritance we are going to use':' operator.

A(add(),sub())
B(operate())
if B extends A,then hw many function will be inherited?
Ans) 2

Inheritance are classified into below types:single,multiple,multilevel,hybrid,hiearchial inheritance.

Explain Diamond problem in inheritance?

--------------------------------------------------------
Creating USer Defined Exceptions:

Divideby Error

SriniException

Rules for USerdefined Exceptions:
---------------------------------
1)Every userdefined exception shld extends baseclass exception class named as "exception".
2)Every userdefined function the class shld throw the exception manually.
3)Catch shld have exception ref as a parameter.
4)You can use either base class or userdefined exception in catch block while handling exceptions.

Obverloading:overloading methods,constructors.But in C++,we can also overloading for operators.(+,-,*)

exa:*,+
::	.*	.	?: cannot be overloaded
